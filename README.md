# Configuring Project

To set up the project you need to have Node 8+ and Yarn 1.16.0+ installed.

Before start it, it is necessary to run the following script on terminal for download the project's dependencies:

`yarn install`


# Running project

After you set up it, start another terminal, because you are going to execute two commands. First you are going to start an API and then run the project.

First, you need to run a simulated API by json-server (dependency that you already installed if you completed the configurantion). For this you can use the following script:

`json-server server.json -p 3001 -w -d 500`

Finally, you can use to start it:

`yarn start`

Wait some seconds and the Project will be start.
